# Open Problem 

- P versus NP is considered as one of the most important open problems in computer science. This consists in knowing the answer of the following question: Is P equal to NP? A precise statement of the P versus NP problem was introduced independently by Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin. Since that date, all efforts to find a proof for this problem have failed. We show some results that prove this outstanding problem with the unexpected solution of P = NP.

# Overview

- In previous years there has been great interest in the verification or checking of computations. Interactive proofs introduced by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff and Babi can be viewed as a model of the verification process. Dwork and Stockmeyer and Condon have studied interactive proofs where the verifier is a space bounded computation instead of the original model where the verifer is a time bounded computation. In addition, Blum and Kannan has studied another model where the goal is to check a computation based solely on the final answer. More about probabilistic logarithmic space verifiers and the complexity class NP has been investigated on a technique of Lipton. In this work, we show some results about the logarithmic space verifiers applied to the class NP and logarithmic space disqualifiers applied to the class coNP which solve one of the most important open problems in computer science, that is P versus NP.

# Programming Techniques

- In this Project, we use the Assertion on the properties of the instances of each problem and the Unit Test for checking the correctness of every reduction. We need to install JDK 8 in order to test the Scala Project. In addition, we need to install SBT to run the unit test (we could run the unit test with the **sbt test** command).
